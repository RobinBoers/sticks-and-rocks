# Sticks and Rocks

Sticks and Rocks is a 2d sandbox game with random terrain to explore written in Javascript.
It uses perlin noise to generate infinite terrain based on a seed. It is playable in the browser, or as a executable for Windows, Linux or MacOS.

It currently has random levels, collusions, and destrucible terrain. I'm still working on the infinite terrain.
